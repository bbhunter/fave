Once an interesting CVE is found, you can pass the CVE-ID to the describe command to gather a more detailed description with references.
This should be in the format <CVE-XXXX-XXXXX>. An example is as follows:

fave describe CVE-1900-01234
`,
	Args: cobra.MatchAll(cobra.MinimumNArgs(1), cobra.MaximumNArgs(1)),
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println(banner)
		api.DescribeCVE(args[0])
	},
