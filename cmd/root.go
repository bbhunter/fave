FAV/E is a CLI tool designed to enable quicker searches of the NIST CVE database.
This tool will give a real-time look at publicly known vulnerabilities for a given
keyword or phrase, all from the command line. 

At this time, internet access is required for the tool to gather data. An offline 
version may be released at a later date, but tools like searchsploit ultimately 
perform the same function that an offline version of this would solve.
